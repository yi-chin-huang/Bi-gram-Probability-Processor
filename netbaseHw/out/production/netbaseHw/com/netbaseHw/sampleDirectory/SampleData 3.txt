“That’s going to be tough because it is getting cold out there,” Boughton said.

There were 20 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, six on Saturday and 27 on Friday. One death of a city resident was reported on Friday. That is the second death in the city in a little over a week. The city had gone since June without a death.

The state put Danbury and 10 other communities on a “red alert” last week because they had 15 or more daily cases per 100,000 people on a 14-day average.

Schools are scheduled to open on the hybrid model next Monday. The city is considered to be in the “moderate” level for schools, which allows for the hybrid model, Boughton said.

The state’s positivity rate is 1.7 percent, which is among the lowest in the country.

The acting health director has been working with a couple “night clubs that call themselves restaurants” that have been “straight-out refusing” to follow coronavirus rules, Boughton said.

“We’ve had some situations where people are clearly not following the guidance,” he said.

Over the weekend, police were called to one establishment and kicked out everyone, Boughton said. No one was arrested, he said. Police did not return a request for comment.

Five bar owners were charged over the 4th of July weekend for violating rules.
