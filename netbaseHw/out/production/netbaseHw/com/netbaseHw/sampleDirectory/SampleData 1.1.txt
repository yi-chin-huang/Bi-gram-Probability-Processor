San Francisco - Sept. 29, 2004 - A recent national study conducted by Ponemon
Institute and sponsored by TRUSTe, an online privacy nonprofit organization,
revealed that 76 percent of consumers are experiencing an increase in spoofing
and phishing incidents and that 35 percent of them receive fake emails at least
once a week. The report estimates the nation's total monetary loss to victims
of these incidents approximately $500 million.

Based on a national sample of 1,335 Internet users across the United States,
seven out of ten respondents revealed that they have unintentionally visited a
spoofed Web site and more than 15 percent of spoofed respondents admit to being
phished, providing sensitive private information including credit card number,
checking account information and Social Security number. In total, a little
more than 2% of all respondents believe that they experienced a direct monetary
loss resulting from the phishing attack. Most people recognized this loss
within the first 2 weeks after being phished.
