DANBURY — City officials continue to monitor whether they need to tighten coronavirus guidelines with Danbury in the “red” because of its case rate.

Mayor Mark Boughton said Monday the city would remain under the third phase of the state’s reopening plan, although the governor has allowed “red alert” communities to roll back to phase two.

“I’m trying to do that as a last resort because I know what it means to businesses in the area,” Boughton said.

But the city may need restaurants to return indoor capacity to 50 percent if the rate worsens over the next couple days, he said.
