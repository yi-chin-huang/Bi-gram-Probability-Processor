1. Hayes has more cash to spend
Hayes started October with $1.5 million in cash to spend on her campaign, compared to Sullivan’s $107,000 cash on hand. Expect Hayes to use her cash advantage to saturate voters in the 41 cities and towns of the 5th District with her message of inclusive leadership. Expect Sullivan to continue his advertising campaign of extolling conservative values and trying to link Hayes to what he calls unpopular priorities of the left.

2. Sullivan is the best-funded Republican of the last three elections
Even before the latest financial disclosure statements were filed with the FEC, Sullivan outraised what the previous two GOP candidates for the 5th District raised combined. Compare Sullivan’s $339,000 raised to date with Clay Cope’s $110,000 in 2016 and Manny Santos’ $76,000 in 2018. Even so, Sullivan is not near the $2 million Mark Greenberg raised in his unsuccessful run in 2014, or the $1.6 million Republican Andrew Roraback raised in his unsuccessful run in 2012.

3. Hayes has maintained her 5-to-1 lead in fundraising
The latest numbers show that Hayes has not let up, despite her lead, raising a total of $1.8 million to Sullivan’s $339,000. In the last quarter, Hayes had a similar 5-to-1 margin, raising $1.3 million to Sullivan’s $235,000.

4. Hayes and Sullivan are closest in spending
The smallest margin between Hayes and Sullivan concerns how much the two had spent on the campaign by the end of September. Only $80,000 separated the incumbent Hayes from the challenger Sullivan. Hayes spent $189,000 on media production, printing, fundraising services and media consultation, according to her records. Sullivan spent $106,000 on mailers, fundraising consultation, voter analysis, web promotion and campaign management, his records show. Don’t expect this spending margin to remain small; Hayes entered October with $1.4 million more to spend than Sullivan.
