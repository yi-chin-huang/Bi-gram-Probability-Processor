U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes maintained her lead in the money race over GOP challenger David X. Sullivan as the candidates reached the final weeks of campaigning for Connecticut’s most competitive congressional seat.

Sullivan worked hard across greater Danbury and the 5th District to raise a total of $100,000 in July, August and September, according to the latest campaign finance disclosure statements filed with the Federal Election Commission. But the incumbent Democrat Hayes raised four times that amount during the same quarter.

That means Hayes started October with a total of $1.49 million in cash to spend, compared to Sullivan’s $107,000.
